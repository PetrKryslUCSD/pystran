# # Check of the 3D beam stiffness matrix
#
# In this example it is demonstrated that the stiffness matrix computed by the
# pystran package results in the same matrix that is assembled from a textbook
# formula that produces the stiffness matrix of in the local beam coordinate
# system, and then transforms it using a 12x12 transformation matrix into the
# global coordinates.
#
# We consider a beam in general orientation, meaning that the joint locations
# are "random" (in the sense of not being special in any way).

# It is possible to proceed in at least two ways: If we support the beam
# sufficiently, we can solve a static problem. Otherwise, we have to assemble
# the stiffness matrix ourselves, because the static solution cannot be run
# successfully with a "floppy", unsupported,  structure. Here we go with the
# second option. The degrees of freedom are numbered, and we can check that the

# one outer product of $12\times1$ strain-displacement matrices for each of two
# numerical quadrature points  (144 operations) for a bending in the x-y plane,
# and  one outer product of $6\times1$ strain-displacement matrices for torsion

# matrices. For each of these products we need to calculate  $12\times12$
