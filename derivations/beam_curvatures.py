# # Beam curvatures

# In this notebook we aim to derive the expression for the curvature of the
# beam, when its deflections are described with the basis functions derived
# earlier.
#
# Recall that the deflection $w$ of the beam in the $x-z$ plane is assumed to
# be described by the expression $w(\xi)=N_1(\xi)W_1 + (h/2)N_2(\xi)W_2 +
# N_3(\xi)W_3 + (h/2)N_4(\xi)W_4=N_1(\xi)w_1 + (h/2)N_2(\xi)\theta_1 +
# N_3(\xi)w_2 + (h/2)N_4(\xi)\theta_2$.
#
# Here the degrees of freedom $W_1=w_1$ (deflection at the left hand side, i.e.
# at $\xi=-1$), $W_2=\theta_1$ (rotation at the left hand side), $W_3=w_2$
# (deflection at the right hand side, i.e. at $\xi=+1$), $W_4=\theta_2$
# (rotation at the right hand side).
#
# Further, the bending moment in the beam is expressed as $M(\xi) = - EI
# \partial^2 w(\xi)/\partial x^2$. The expression $\partial^2 w(\xi)/\partial
# x^2$ is referred to as curvature of the curve $w(\xi)$.
#
# Note that the curvature is expressed in terms of the nondimensional
# parametric coordinate $\xi$, but we need to take the derivatives with respect
# to $x$, the physical coordinates along the length of the beam.

xi = symbols("xi")
a, b, c, d = symbols("a b c d")


# The coefficient matrix `C` that defines the four conditions (deflection and
# slope at either end of the beam), and the vector of their unknown
# coefficients $a, b, c$, and $d$ are defined first. The first row corresponds
# to deflection at $\xi=-1$, the second to the slope at $\xi=-1$, and the third
# and fourth to the deflection and slope at $\xi=+1$.


C = Matrix([[1, -1, 1, -1], [0, 1, -2, 3], [1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 2, 3]])
abcd = Matrix([[a], [b], [c], [d]])


# Previously we have shown that the first basis function results from this
# equality:


sol = solve(Eq(C * abcd, Matrix([[1], [0], [0], [0]])))
N1 = sum(coeff * xi**j for j, coeff in enumerate(sol.values()))
print(N1)


# The second basis function results from


sol = solve(Eq(C * abcd, Matrix([[0], [-1], [0], [0]])))
N2 = sum(coeff * xi**j for j, coeff in enumerate(sol.values()))
print(N2)


# The third basis function follows from the deflection at $\xi=+1$


sol = solve(Eq(C * abcd, Matrix([[0], [0], [+1], [0]])))
N3 = sum(coeff * xi**j for j, coeff in enumerate(sol.values()))
print(N3)


# and, finally, the fourth basis function is


sol = solve(Eq(C * abcd, Matrix([[0], [0], [0], [-1]])))
N4 = sum(coeff * xi**j for j, coeff in enumerate(sol.values()))
print(N4)


# The mapping between the physical coordinate $x$ (the beam extends between $0$
# and $h$, where $h$ is the length of the beam) and the parametric coordinate
# $-1\le\xi\le+1$ can be set up as $x = (\xi+1)/2\times h$. The jacobian
# $J=\partial x/\partial \xi=h/2$ can be used to link derivatives of the  shape
# functions with respect to the physical coordinate to the derivatives with
# respect to the parametric coordinate

# $$
# \partial N_k(\xi)/ \partial x=\partial N_k(\xi) / \partial \xi \times (J)^{-1} = (2/h) \partial N_k(\xi) / \partial \xi
# $$
#
# This may be continued with a second derivative

# $$
# \partial N^2_k(\xi)/ \partial x^2=\partial N^2_k(\xi) / \partial \xi^2 \times (J)^{-2} = (2/h)^2 \partial N^2_k(\xi) / \partial \xi^2
# $$
#

# So now we can take what we have learned above and symbolically compute the
# second derivatives of all four basis functions.


h = symbols("h")


# So for instance the second derivative of the first basis function with
# respect to $x$ reads


d2N1x2 = diff(N1, xi, 2) * (2 / h) ** 2
print("d2N1x2 = ", d2N1x2)


# and therefore


d2N2x2 = diff(N2, xi, 2) * (2 / h) ** 2
print("d2N2x2 = ", d2N2x2)
d2N3x2 = diff(N3, xi, 2) * (2 / h) ** 2
print("d2N3x2 = ", d2N3x2)
d2N4x2 = diff(N4, xi, 2) * (2 / h) ** 2
print("d2N4x2 = ", d2N4x2)


# Note that all the second derivatives (curvatures) are linear functions of the
# position along the length of the beam. This is consistent with our
# expectation that the beam will vary linearly from one end to the other.

# The curvature of the beam is a fundamental quantity. It depends linearly on
# the degrees of freedom $W_k$. Such a relationship can be expressed with a
# matrix expression. The crucial matrix is the curvature-displacement matrix,
# $B$:


B = Matrix([d2N1x2, (h / 2) * d2N2x2, d2N3x2, (h / 2) * d2N4x2]).reshape(1, 4)
