# # Derivation of beam shape functions

# In this notebook we aim to derive the cubic  functions that describe the
# shape of a Bernoulli-Euler beam. The python package `sympy` is used for the
# symbolic manipulations.


from sympy import *
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# Each of the four shape functions of a beam will be expressed in the
# parametric coordinate $\xi$, as a cubic function $N_k=a_k+b_k \xi+c_k
# \xi^2+d_k\xi^3$.


xi = symbols("xi")
a, b, c, d = symbols("a b c d")
N = a + b * xi + c * xi**2 + d * xi**3


# The derivatives of these functions may be expressed as


dNdxi = diff(N, xi)
d2Ndxi2 = diff(N, xi, 2)
d3Ndxi3 = diff(N, xi, 3)
print(dNdxi)
print(d2Ndxi2)
print(d3Ndxi3)


# The four coefficients for each of the four shape functions may be computed
# from four conditions: these conditions are the value and slope of the shape
# function at either end of the interval $-1\le \xi \le +1$. For instance, the
# first shape function, $N_1$, should have a value of +1 at $\xi=-1$. So the
# polynomial expression proposed above evaluated at  $\xi=-1$ reads


N.subs(xi, -1)


# and should be equal to 1. Further, the slope at $\xi=-1$ and the value and
# the slope at $\xi=+1$ should all be zero.


dNdxi.subs(xi, -1)


N.subs(xi, +1)


dNdxi.subs(xi, +1)


# Thus we have these four equations

# $$
# \begin{array}{l}
# a-b+c-d=1 \\
# b-2c+3d=0 \\
# a+b+c+d=0 \\
# b+2c+3d=0
# \end{array}
# $$

# and we can solve them for the coefficients $a, b, c, d$.
#
# This very same system of equations may be written as a matrix expression
# defining the coefficient matrix `C` and the vector of the unknown coefficient
# `abcd`.


C = Matrix([[1, -1, 1, -1], [0, 1, -2, 3], [1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 2, 3]])
abcd = Matrix([[a], [b], [c], [d]])


# The equality above may then be written as


Eq(C * abcd, Matrix([[1], [0], [0], [0]]))


# and solved for the coefficients as


sol = solve(Eq(C * abcd, Matrix([[1], [0], [0], [0]])))
N1 = sum(coeff * xi**j for j, coeff in enumerate(sol.values()))
print(N1)


# We see the first shape function follow
# as $N_1 = (2 - 3/4\xi + \xi^3)/4$.

# The second shape function should correspond to a positive unit rotation at
# $\xi=-1$, and therefore to a negative slope.


Eq(C * abcd, Matrix([[0], [-1], [0], [0]]))


sol = solve(Eq(C * abcd, Matrix([[0], [-1], [0], [0]])))
N2 = sum(coeff * xi**j for j, coeff in enumerate(sol.values()))
print(N2)


# The second shape function is therefore $N_2=(-1+\xi+\xi^2-\xi^3)/4$.

# The third shape function should have a value of +1 at $\xi=+1$.


sol = solve(Eq(C * abcd, Matrix([[0], [0], [+1], [0]])))
N3 = sum(coeff * xi**j for j, coeff in enumerate(sol.values()))
print(N3)


# Which gives $N_3=(2+3\xi-\xi^3)/4$

# Finally, the fourth shape function should represent rotation at $\xi=+1$ (and
# again, the slope is the negative of the rotation).


sol = solve(Eq(C * abcd, Matrix([[0], [0], [0], [-1]])))
N4 = sum(coeff * xi**j for j, coeff in enumerate(sol.values()))
print(N4)


# The fourth shape function is therefore $N_4=(+1+\xi-\xi^2-\xi^3)/4$.
