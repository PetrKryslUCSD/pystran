# # Beam stiffness matrix

# In this notebook we derive the stiffness matrix of the basic beam. We assume
# that the cross section is uniform: the beam is prismatic.

# The fundamental  building blocks will be expressions for the cubic (Hermite)
# basis functions.

N1 = xi**3 / 4 - 3 * xi / 4 + 1 / 2
N2 = -(xi**3) / 4 + xi**2 / 4 + xi / 4 - 1 / 4

# The bending moment is given as $M(\xi) = - EI \partial^2 w(\xi)/\partial
# x^2$. With the curvature-displacement matrix $B$ and a vector of the degrees
# of freedom, $W$, where $W_1=w_1$ (deflection at the left hand side, i.e. at
# $\xi=-1$), $W_2=\theta_1$ (rotation at the left hand side), $W_3=w_2$
# (deflection at the right hand side, i.e. at $\xi=+1$), $W_4=\theta_2$
# (rotation at the right hand side), we can write
#
# $$ M(\xi) = - EI B(\xi) W $$
#
# Using `sympy` we write

W = Matrix([[W_1], [W_2], [W_3], [W_4]])

# The curvature-displacement matrix $B$ is constructed from the second
# derivatives of the basis functions with respect to $x$,


d2N1x2 = diff(N1, xi, 2) * (2 / h) ** 2
d2N2x2 = diff(N2, xi, 2) * (2 / h) ** 2

# So now we can define symbolically an expression for the bending moment (`(B *
# W)` is a $1\times1$ matrix, and by subscripting with `[0]` we make it into a
# scalar):


M = -E * I * (B * W)[0]
print("M = ", M)


# Note that the bending moment along the beam varies linearly as a function of
# $\xi$, and depends linearly on $W_1, ..., W_4$.

# We are looking for the stiffness matrix of the beam, namely  the matrix $K$
# that gives the forces acting on the endpoints of the beam $F$ in terms of the
# displacements $W$ (well, generalized displacements, really, since they
# include translations and rotations). So
#
# $$ F = K \times W $$

# We can obtain the entries of the stiffness matrix using Castigliano's
# theorem. First we express the strain energy stored in the beam as
#
# $$ U  = (1/2) \int_0^h M^2/(EI) dx = 1/(2EI) \int_{-1}^{+1} M^2 d\xi (h/2) =
# h/(4EI)\int_{-1}^{+1} M^2 d\xi $$
#
# where we can symbolically evaluate the necessary integral as


U = h / (4 * E * I) * integrate(M**2, (xi, -1, +1))
print(simplify(U))


# Now the partial derivative of the strain energy  $U$ with respect to the first degree of freedom $W_1$ will reveal the work-conjugate generalized force,  namely the shear force that works on the first degree of freedom (vertical displacement at the left hand side end)


print(simplify(diff(U, W_1)))


# This is actually the first row of the $4\times4$ stiffness matrix multiplied
# by the degrees of freedom. The first row of the stiffness matrix can
# therefore be written as
#
# $$ [12 EI/h^3, -6EI/h^2, -12 EI/h^3, -6EI/h^2] $$
#
# And similarly the second row follows as


print(simplify(diff(U, W_2)))


# The remaining two rows follow from


print(simplify(diff(U, W_3)))
print(simplify(diff(U, W_4)))


# The weighted residual method (the method of choice in the book) states that
# the stiffness matrix can be obtained as
#
# $$ K = EI \int_{-1}^{+1} B^T B \; d\xi\; (h/2) $$

# The symbolic code below does precisely this.


K = E * I * integrate(B.T * B, (xi, -1, 1)) * (h / 2)
print(K)


# Note that the matrix `K` is symmetric


K - K.T


# We can finally show that the same result for the stiffness matrix can be
# obtained with numerical integration. Here we use a two-point Gauss rule,
# which should be "exact", since the integrand is only a quadratic function of
# $\xi$. `B1` is a numerical matrix obtained by substituting $\xi$ into the
# symbolic expression for $B$.


xiG = [-1 / sqrt(3), 1 / sqrt(3)]
WG = [1, 1]
K = zeros(4, 4)
for q in range(2):
    B1 = B.subs(xi, xiG[q])
    K += E * I * B1.T * B1 * WG[q] * (h / 2)
print(simplify(K))


# It is also possible to go backwards at this point: express the strain energy
# $U$ using the matrix quantities as $(1/2)W^TKW$. We should get the same
# expression for $U$ as above.


simplify(U - (1 / 2) * (W.T * K * W)[0])


# Note that we had to write `(W.T * K * W)[0]`, because `(W.T * K * W)` is a
# $1\times1$ matrix, and therefore we cannot subtract it from the scalar $U$.

# We also note here that the coefficients of the stiffness matrix can be
# obtained as second derivatives of the strain function. For instance
#
# $$ \frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial W_1 \partial W_2} $$
#
# yields
#


diff(diff(U, W_1), W_2)


# We should have gotten $K_{12}$:


simplify(K[0, 1])
