# Using `pystran` with python running in a terminal



The detailed instructions are as follows:

Change your current working directory (folder)
to be the folder where your script is located (it could be a tutorial that comes with the package).
Then run `py` (or `python`)

There is a `scripts` folder for storage of your own scripts, if convenient.


## Plotting

By default python will display the plots in separate figures which allow for interaction.
That means that the figure needs to be closed before the script can proceed.
