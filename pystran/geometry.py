def member_2d_geometry(i, j):

    A local coordinate system is attached to the member such that the :math:`x`

    in the :math:`x-z` plane.

    Parameters
    ----------
    i

    j
        Dictionary holding data for second joint.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple of e_x, e_z, h
        Vector :math:`e_x` is the direction vector along the axis of the
        member. :math:`e_z` is the direction vector perpendicular to the axis
        of the member. These two vectors form a left-handed coordinate system
        (consistent with the sign convention in the book): The deflection
        :math:`w` is measured positive downwards, while the :math:`x`
        coordinate is measured left to right. So in two dimensions :math:`e_x`
        and :math:`e_z` form a left-handed coordinate system. In reality, the
        complete coordinate system is right-handed, as the not-used basis
        vector is :math:`e_y`, which points out of the plane of the screen (page).

def member_3d_geometry(i, j, xz_vector):
    r"""
    Compute 3d member geometry.

    A local coordinate system is attached to the member such that the :math:`x`
    axis is along the member axis. The deformation of the member is considered
    in the :math:`x-y` and :math:`x-z` plane.

    The plane :math:`x-z` is defined by the vector ``xz_vector`` and the member
    axis (i.e. :math:`e_x`). Therefore, the vector ``xz_vector`` must not be
    parallel to the member axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    i
        Dictionary holding data for first joint.
    j
        Dictionary holding data for second joint.
    xz_vector
        The vector that defines the :math:`x-z` plane of the member-local
        coordinate system. It does not need to be of unit length, but it must
        not be parallel to the member axis. This vector is not defined for a
        truss member, and will be passed in as empty. Heuristics will be then
        used to orient the planes.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple of e_x, e_y, e_z, h
        Vector :math:`e_x` is the direction vector along the axis of the
        member. :math:`e_z` is the direction vector perpendicular to the axis
        of the member. These two vectors form a right-handed coordinate system,
