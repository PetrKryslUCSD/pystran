pystran - Python package for structural analysis with trusses and beams 

(C) 2025, Petr Krysl

This package is intended for educational purposes only. Professional users may
find it too bare bones.

The approach is based on classical weighted residual formulation (Galerkin). The
formulations are derived in the "Finite element modeling with shells and beams"
[book](http://hogwarts.ucsd.edu/~pkrysl/femstructures-book/).
