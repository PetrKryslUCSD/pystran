# We begin with the standard imports:

import math
import numpy

# Here is a Python list:
al = [1, 2, 3]
# we can make and array from it:
am = numpy.array(al)
print(am)

# A two dimensional array (matrix) can be made from a list of lists:
A = 1000.0 * numpy.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
print("A = ", A)

# We can access the type of the elements of the matrix and its shape:
print(f"Type ({A.dtype}) and shape ({A.shape}) of A")

# Individual elements (entries) of the matrix can be accessed by their indices:
print("Top left - A[0, 0] = ", A[0, 0])
print("Bottom left - A[2, 0] = ", A[2, 0])
print("Top right - A[0, 2] = ", A[0, 2])
print("Bottom right - A[2, 2] = ", A[2, 2])

# Indices are really the offsets of the rows and columns from the top left corner.
# Therefore to access row r=2 and column c=3, we use A[r-1, c-1] = A[1, 2].

# So called slicing can be used to extract submatrices:
print("Top row - A[0, :] = ", A[0, :])
print("Rightmost column - A[:, -1] = ", A[:, -1])
# The colon means "all elements in the row/column". The minus sign means
# "counting from the end".

# A list like this
B = numpy.array([6, -7])
# produces a vector.
print(B.shape)

# The length of this vector can be computed using the dot product of two vectors.
print("Length of B = ", math.sqrt(numpy.dot(B, B)))

# Two vectors can be added or subtracted.
C = numpy.array([3, 2])

print("B + C = ", B + C)

# The diagonal of the square matrix A
print("A = ", A)
# can be extracted as follows:
print("Diagonal of A = ", numpy.diag(A))

# Square matrices are often transposed:
print("Transpose of A = ", A.T)

# Matrix is symmetric if it is equal to its transpose, i.e., A - A.T is the zero matrix:
print("A - A.T = ", A - A.T)
# This matrix is not symmetric.

# A matrix can be decomposed into its symmetric and antisymmetric part.
# The symmetric part is (A + A.T)/2, the antisymmetric part is (A - A.T)/2.
As = (A + A.T) / 2
Aa = (A - A.T) / 2
print("Symmetric part of A = ", As)
print("Antisymmetric part of A = ", Aa)

# Here is an identity matrix:
I = numpy.eye(4)

# And a zero matrix:
Z = numpy.zeros((3, 3))
print(Z)

# Matrices can be added and subtracted if they have the same shape.
D = numpy.random.rand(3, 4)
E = numpy.random.rand(3, 4)

print("D = ", D)
print("E = ", E)
print("E+D = ", E + D)

# If we are not interested in as many decimal places, we can use the printoptions.
with numpy.printoptions(precision=3):
    print("E+D = ", E + D)

# Matrices can be multiplied by scalars.
print("2000 * D = ", 2000 * D)

# Matrices can be multiplied together if they have compatible shapes (the number
# of columns in the first matrix matches the number of rows of the second
# matrix). There is a function for matrix multiplication called dot.
F = numpy.random.rand(4, 3)
G = numpy.random.rand(4, 3)
print("F = ", F)
print("G = ", G)
# We cannot multiply F and G because they do not have compatible shapes.

except ValueError:
    print('Incompatible!')       
# But we can multiply F and G.T because they have compatible shapes.
print("F*G.T = ", numpy.dot(F, G.T))


# Vectors can be used in the so called outer product to produce matrices.
B = numpy.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
print("B = ", B)
print("Outer product of B with itself = \n ", numpy.outer(B, B))

K = numpy.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

# dependent on the first one.
