# Continuous beam with two spans: refine a member into multiple elements

## Problem description:

Alternative version of 08_refine_member_tut.py. Joint and member identifiers
are strings.

Variation on  02_continuous_beam_2_spans_consist_tut.py. The member 2 is
**refined** into three members automatically.
