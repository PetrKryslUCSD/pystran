# Penalty enforcement of supports

## Problem description:

Statically determinate simply-supported truss is loaded with forces. Both the
pin and the roller, which is on an inclined plane, are enforced using a penalty
formulation with extension springs.

## References

This example is completely solved in the book Matrix Analysis of Structures by
Robert E. Sennett, ISBN 978-1577661436 (Example 7.3 on page 134).
